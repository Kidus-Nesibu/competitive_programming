# Competitive Programming 🚀

Welcome to **Competitive_Programming** — my personal archive of problem-solving journeys across platforms like **LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, and GeeksforGeeks**.

This repository exists for one mission:

> **Master data structures, algorithms, and competitive problem-solving — one problem at a time.**

Each platform has its own folder with structured solutions, explanations, and notes.  
This README serves as a clean entry point to the entire workspace.
